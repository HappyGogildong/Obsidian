torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 512.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 11.99 GiB of which 0 bytes is free. Of the allocated memory 23.95 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 193.86 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.  See documentation for Memory Management  (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#environment-variables)
